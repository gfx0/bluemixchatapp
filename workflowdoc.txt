Pretty good overview of dev process with this:

+ node js command prompt, for npm building, local testing
+ apache local webserver running for quick localhost tests
+ cf logs testingnodejsapp --- follow logs on server and console output of server
+ cf push testingnodejsapp --- for pushing while tarcking server changes
+ 10 billion chromes open for testing various s**t
